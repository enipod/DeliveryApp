# DeliveryApp
This open-source project involves creating randomized locations (or edges) and applying the Bellman-Ford algorithm to find the shortest distance to deliver products.

### Status

Currently this is a **WIP**. I've set down the steps to achieve this goal, and they are: 
1. Set up the base level code
2. Create the following random entities/classes: Location, Order, DeliveryMachine
3. Implement the logic behind a Delivery
4. Implement the Bellman-Ford algorithm, and pair it with the logic behind the delivery
5. Finalize bits and pieces: test, refactor, add comments.


*I will be adding all resources in this ReadMe file, after I've completed the steps mentioned.*
